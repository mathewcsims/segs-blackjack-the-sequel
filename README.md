## BBC SEGS Blackjack Tech Test - the sequel

This is my second iteration of code to solve this task. My first attempt (aborted because I had concentrated on making the game playable rather than on ensuring my code passed the set tests, is at [segs-blackjack](https://github.com/mathewcsims/segs-blackjack)).

The game implements a simple, single-player version of blackjack. You can play the game by running `blackjack.py`. The code should run on any installation of Python 3.x (3.8 used for development and testing) without any additional requirements.

Several unit tests are available, which can be run using `python3 -m unittest discover test` from the main directory (containing `blackjack.py`).
